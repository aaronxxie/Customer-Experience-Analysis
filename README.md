# The Problem
Customer rating is a crucial metric to show how satisfied customers are with a business. Therefore, this project examinates the relationship between customer rating and the shipping features. What are the potential drawbacks of the low customer ratings?

## The Questions
Shipping performance:
* What are the total cost and shipping amount?
* Which block/department has the highest shipping amount?
* What is the most preferred ship mode?
* Are the products gender neutral?
* How much does the products usually cost?
* How does the business offer discount based on cost?

Customer experience:
* What are the average customer ratings?
* Which customer feature is related to customer ratings?
* Does the on time rate matter to customer ratings?
* Can increasing discount offered raise customer ratings?
* How many customers care calls does the business usually receive?
* Does more care call mean bad experience(bad ratings)?
* Does high prior purchases mean good experience(good ratings)?

## The Goal
* Find the drawbacks that the business can improve to increase customer ratings.
* Make strategies to overcome these drawbacks and raise the customer ratings by 20%
